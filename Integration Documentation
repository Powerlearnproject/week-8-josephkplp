1. Import Data from SQL Database to Excel
To import data from a SQL database into Excel:

Open Excel.

Go to the 'Data' tab on the ribbon.

Click on Get Data > From Database > From SQL Server Database.

If you are using a MySQL database, choose From Other Sources > From ODBC and configure the MySQL ODBC connection.
Enter the SQL Server details (or MySQL connection) in the pop-up dialog box:

Server name: Enter the name of your SQL server (e.g., localhost or db.server.com).
Database name: Enter the name of the database that contains your data.
Choose how you want to access the data:

Write a SQL Query: Enter a custom SQL query to extract only the data you need.
Select from a list: Browse tables or views and select the desired data for analysis.
Once the data is loaded, it will appear in your Excel worksheet.

2. Create a Pivot Table to Summarize Birth Outcomes
Assuming your data has columns like Outcome, Birth Type, Date, etc., follow these steps to create a pivot table:

Select your data range (or the table created after importing data).

Go to the 'Insert' tab on the ribbon.

Click on Pivot Table:

In the dialog box, confirm the data range and choose where to place the pivot table (in a new worksheet or the current one).
Set up your pivot table:

Drag the Outcome field to the Rows area.
Drag any identifier like Birth ID (or a countable field) to the Values area. Ensure that the value is set to Count to get the number of live births and stillbirths.
Optionally, you can add Date to the Columns area if you want to break down the data by year or month.
Your pivot table will now summarize the outcomes (e.g., live births vs. stillbirths).

3. Create a Dashboard to Visualize Birth Outcomes
To visualize the data using charts in Excel, follow these steps:

Select the Pivot Table.

Go to the 'Insert' tab and choose a chart type. Some useful charts for your scenario might include:

Bar Chart or Column Chart to show the number of live births vs. stillbirths.
Pie Chart to show the proportion of each outcome.
Line Chart if you're looking at trends over time.
Customize the chart:

Click on the chart and use the Chart Tools options in the ribbon to customize the appearance.
Add titles, labels, and legends to make the chart clear.
Create the Dashboard:

If you're using multiple charts, you can place them in one sheet to form a dashboard.
Resize and position charts to fit neatly on the worksheet.
You can also use slicers (in the PivotTable Analyze tab) to make your dashboard interactive. Slicers allow you to filter the data based on fields like Date or Location.
